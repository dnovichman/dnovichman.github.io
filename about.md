Rokel Delivery Services (RDS) is a small startup company that produces autonomous aerial delivery systems for medical products to remote/rural areas and within congested cities. Our aerial vehicles are developed with significant emphasis on robustness (using fusion of multiple sensors) and ease of deployment. The majority of our team members either have or are about to obtain a PhD in robotics, computer vision or related areas. Our partners have established market opportunities with the governments of Ghana, Liberia and Sierra Leone. 

We are now at the stage where we are soliciting investments to develop and deliver the final product to our customers. One of many prototypes being trialled is shown in the figure.
