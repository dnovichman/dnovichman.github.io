Rokel Delivery Services (RDS) is a small startup company producing drones that can deliver medical aid to remote/rural and congested cities. We are currently developing the vehicles with a significant emphasis on robustness (using fusion of multiple sensors) and ease of deployment. The majority of our team members either have or are about to obtain a PhD in robotics, computer vision or related areas. Our partners have established market opportunities with the governments of Ghana, Liberia and Sierra Leone. 

We are now at the stage where we are soliciting investment to develop and deliver the final product.


One of many prototypes being trialled is shown in the figure.
